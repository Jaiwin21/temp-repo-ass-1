        <h1>Personal statement</h1>
        
        
    <p>I am a highly motivated and integral individual, who has recently completed their A-Levels, achieving excellent grades in both Math's and Science, nearly 3 years ago for GCSE’s. In the past, I had undergone training and subsequently obtained an adequate amount of experience in serving and working with customers, as a result, I understand the importance of customer satisfaction and service. I always aim to do whatever role or job that is assigned to me with integrity and pride whilst ensuring that I enjoy myself whilst allowing, not only the customers but, my fellow colleagues to be boosted morally by my charisma. I have won quite a few achievements in the past before such as ‘Employee of the month’ twice in the same year, from my previous work place for my hard work and consistent dedication, as I kept everyone that worked around me motivated and on task.</p>

       <p> In my free time, I find it rather calming to play the piano, as I've been going to music school since a young age over the weekends. I also enjoy reading books, particularly ones that are focused around philosophy. I could go on about how much I'm fascinated by Nietzsche’s prominent nihilistic views whilst offering such as a robust view into such an opposing ideology in his book ‘Beyond good and evil’. On some occasions, I do tend to relax and play video games as well, as I am rather enthusiastic on that topic.</p>
