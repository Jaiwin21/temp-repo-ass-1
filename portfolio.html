    <h2>My Blogs</h2>
    <p>As you can see above, these are some exmaples of the blogs that I had posted. The first one is about war and philosophy, in particularly about a character called Itachi. The second one is about a war god called "Yato" which was for a community challenge. The third one is about a Japanese folklore and about a character called "Tanjiro". The final one is another community challenge blog entry about family. </p>
